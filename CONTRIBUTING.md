### 1Ô∏è‚É£. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix using the following command:
```bash
git checkout -b fix-your-branch-name
```

#### Branching Model

This will help you organize your contributions effectively:

> **Note:** All the commits and branches should be in lowercase.

- Use hyphens to separate words in your branch names (e.g., `feat-user-profile`) for maximum clarity.
- Prefix your branch names with the type of change you're making:
  - `feat-`: Adds new features or capabilities.
  - `fix-`: Resolves bugs or issues.
  - `docs-`: Updates documentation.
  - `style-`: Changes code style (formatting, spacing, etc.).
  - `refactor-`: Improves code structure without changing behavior.
  - `impr-`: Improves performance and/or code structure.
  - `test-`: Adds or modifies tests.
  - `build-`: Changes build system or dependencies.
  - `ci-`: Updates CI/CD configuration.
  - `chore-`: Handles routine maintenance tasks.
- Include the GitHub issue number in your branch name (e.g., `feat-123-user-profile`) to establish a clear link.
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive (under 72 characters for the title).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£. Write Your Code

Write your code and follow the coding conventions (if any).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£. Test Your Code

Test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message. For example:
```markdown

```
#### Types of Commits

> **Note:** All the commits and branches should be in lowercase.

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf`: Changes that improve performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Maintenance changes that do not fall into any of the other categories

### 5. Push Your Changes

Push your branch to the original repository:
```bash
git push origin fix-your-branch-name
```

**Code Review**
------------------

Once you've pushed your changes, a reviewer will be assigned to review your code. Follow the reviewer's feedback to resolve any issues.

**Pull Request** üéØ
------------------

When you're ready to share your contributions with the world, it's time to create a pull request that showcases your work:  

 1Ô∏è‚É£. Craft a clear, descriptive title that captures the essence of your changes.    
 2Ô∏è‚É£. Highlight the key points of your modifications in the description.  
 3Ô∏è‚É£. Keep your PRs focused and manageable by addressing a single, well-defined task.  
 4Ô∏è‚É£. Don't forget to test your changes before submitting a PR as ready to review to ensure a smooth integration and PR rejections.  

For instance, a PR titled "\[web] enhance integration with smart contracts" provides a concise summary of the improvement made and the component of the application being updated.
